# 1. INTRODUCTION

To get the most out of your Tonverk, we recommend that you read this manual in its entirety. 

# 1.1 CONVENTIONS IN THIS MANUAL

We have used the following conventions throughout the manual: 

â€¢ Key names are written in upper case, bold style and within brackets. For instance, the key labeled â€œFUNCâ€ on the main panel is written as [FUNC]. 

â€¢ Knobs are written in upper case, bold, italic letters. For instance, the knob â€œLevel/Dataâ€ is written LEVEL/DATA. 

â€¢ Menu names are written in upper case letters. The SETTINGS menu is an example of that. 

â€¢ Parameter names and certain menu options where settings can be made or actions performed are written in bold, upper case letters. For example, NOTE. 

â€¢ Upper case letters are used for parameter setting alternatives. For example, OFF. 

â€¢ Messages visible on the screen are written in upper case letters with quotation marks. For example, â€œQUANTIZED RECORDINGâ€. 

â€¢ LED indicators like the keyboard octave LEDs are written like this: <KEYBOARD OCTAVE>. 

The following symbols are used throughout the manual:

A tip that will make it easier for you to interact with Tonverk. 

# 2. THE TONVERK

Weâ€™re thrilled to introduce you to Tonverk. In many ways, Tonverk is an instrument synonymous with the journey, with adventure. Its own arrival is the result of plenty of exciting twists and turns. From launch, it opens up countless sonic journeys in different directions, and in many respects, its own path is only just beginning. 

As we dreamt up this machine, we knew it would be more than just a new instrument. It would signal the first steps on the latest Elektron platform, injecting new possibilities into our portfolio. With broader answers possible, we considered how we sample, and how we sculpt sound. Where could Tonverk take us, and what more could we do along the way? 

The result is a powerful workstation. A versatile, playful, creative one. It adapts to whatever you want to do with it. A labyrinth full of routes, a pathfinder full of revelations. Sixteen varied tracks - eight of them audio with multiple machines, polyphonic stereo sampling, a kaleidoscope of effects and modulation, multisampled instruments, subtracks within tracks, and routing itself pushed until it becomes a playground. Whether youâ€™re multisampling your favorite synth, building unique drum kits, or routing sounds out and back in again for further alchemy, Tonverk is ready to take you there. 

Its journey - and yours with it - has only just begun. 

Sincerely, 

The Elektron Team

# 4.4 THE ROUTING MENU

FADETonverk features a flexible routing setup that allows you to direct sound from multiple sources (audio tracks, buses, send FXs, and external inputs) to various destinations (device outputs, buses, and tracks). Every audio track, bus, and send FX has its own routing. Routing is primarily performed in the Routing menu. You FROM EFFECT SENDSLFO DESTINATIONcan also route the active audio track, bus, or send FX using the ROUT parameter on FX PAGE 1. You can INTERNALINSERT FX 1 INSERT FX 2only route the external inputs on the Mix trackâ€™s SRC page. 

![image](images/861b0f9227c763f86c874c10cef9847c4109f35031ccbc0673b10de6b17936e9.jpg)


# 4.4.1 ROUTING TRACKS

1. Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [MUTE] to open the ROUTING menu. 

2. Use [UP]/[DOWN] to select the track group you want to view (tracks, buses/send FX). 

3. Use the [TRIG] keys to select the track you want to route, and then use LEVEL/DATA to select a routing destination. 

4. Press [NO] to exit and close the ROUTING menu. 

The possible routing destinations vary depending on the track type/source. 

â€¢ Audio track sound destinations: MIX AB, OUT CD, OUT EF, BUS 1â€“4 Routing switches are shown with â€œAâ€ in the sound architecture illustrations above. 

Bus track sound destinations: MIX AB, OUT CD, OUT EF Routing switches are shown with â€œBâ€ in the sound architecture illustrations above. 

Send FX track sound destinations: MIX AB, OUT CD, OUT EF, Routing switches are shown with $" C '$ in the sound architecture illustrations above. 

![image](images/e2ceea96f8ada327aeed70d0cc7bfd7f83354e827f1b12313f4e26ae6359d318.jpg)


The MIX AB destination is always routed (through the main FX) to outputs A/B. It is also, by default, routed to outputs E/F (Headphones). The level of the signal to E/F (Headphones) can be set on the MIX trackâ€™s FLTR page using the HP.MON parameter. This level control is indicated by the letter â€œEâ€ in the sound architecture illustrations above. 

You can also use a key combination to route the track to different destinations in the ROUTING menu. Press and hold the [TRIG] key(s) for the track(s) you want to route, then press the [TRIG] key representing the routing destination. The OUT CD and OUT EF destinations is selected with [KEYBOARD A] and [KEYBOARD B] respectively. 

The external audio inputs can also be routed to several destinations: MIX AB, OUT AB, OUT CD, OUT EF, BUS 1â€“4, TRK 1â€“8. However, these settings can only be performed on the SRC page of the Mix track, and not in the ROUTING menu. Routing switches for the external inputs are indicated by the letter â€œDâ€ in the sound architecture illustrations above. 

The two sources of external audio input, audio over USB and audio from the IN A/B inputs, are merged, processed, and treated as a single source of input. 

â€¢ When selecting a track as a destination for the external inputs, the audio is routed directly to the insert effects and not through the trackâ€™s overdrive, filters, or amp. 

# 5. OVERVIEW OF THE TONVERK STRUCTURE

The illustration below outlines the Tonverk structure. 

![image](images/89b503d1fb5d6bd0600091b4a38d195581cb3301d55828be65e8ad229e124c62.jpg)


# 5.1 SD CARD

The SD card contains Tonverk data, where Projects, Presets, Instruments, Samples, and global settings are stored. The amount of data you can store on the SD card depends on the size of the SD card. Tonverk comes with a 64 GB SD card. The recommended minimum card size is 2 GB, and it must be formatted in exFAT format. For more information, please see â€œ6.11 SAMPLE BROWSERâ€ on page 24. 

# 5.2 DATA STRUCTURE

# 5.2.1 PROJECT

A project contains 128 patterns. The project also stores general settings and states. The currently loaded project becomes the active working state of Tonverk. From here, it is possible to edit the patterns and presets of the project. Every time Tonverk is switched on, it boots to the active working state, the active project. Projects are saved, loaded, and managed in the FILE menu. For more information, please see $^ { * } 9 . 1$ THE FILE MENUâ€ on page 31. 

# 5.2.2 SONGS

A song is an arrangement of patterns set up to play in sequence. Each row in the SONG mode arrangement can have separate settings for pattern, row repeat, row length, and tempo. A song can be up to 99 rows in length, and each project can contain up to 16 songs. For more information, please see â€œ10.11 SONG MODEâ€ on page 43. 

# 5.2.3 PATTERNS

The patterns are the primary data container for Tonverk. Sixteen patterns are available for each of the eight banks, resulting in 128 patterns for each project. A pattern contains up to 12 presets (one for each audio or MIDI track), plus sequencer data like trigs and parameter locks. It also includes the settings on the TRIG page, as well as BPM, length, swing, and time signature settings. For more information, please see â€œ10. THE SEQUENCERâ€ on page 35. 

# 5.2.4 SAMPLES

Tonverk can load and play WAV and AIFF audio files (samples) with 16/24/32-bit depth (floating and fixed point) and a sample rate of 48 kHz (mono and stereo interleaved). Files with other sample rates (44.1 kHz/ 88.2 kHz/96 kHz) can also be loaded, but they will gracefully degrade in quality when played back. You can load up to 4 GB of samples in a projectâ€™s internal memory, using a maximum of 1023 sample slots. Samples are stored on the SD card, and the size and number of those samples are limited only by the available free space on the SD card. For more information, please see ${ } ^ { " 9 . }$ . PATTERNS, PRESETS, IN-STRUMENTS AND SAMPLESâ€ on page 31. 

![image](images/f2383dee308e5ef8e966670265a171f9b09b5a985186883c6d39729630206d0e.jpg)


All samples that are played on a track in Tonverk are played back with an attenuation (lowering of volume) of -22dB to maintain headroom in the device. The sample files themselves are unaffected. 

# 5.3 MACHINES AND TRACKS

The Tonverk sequencer has 16 tracks. 8 Audio/MIDI tracks, 4 Bus and MIDI tracks, 3 Send FX tracks, and one Mix track. 

# 5.3.1 MACHINES

A machine is a module within Tonverk that has specific functionality. A machine can be replaced with another machine of the same category. For example, different audio sample playback engines (SRC machines) or a selection of effects (FX machines). Every machine has a specific set of parameters tailored to give you the most useful sound-shaping possibilities for that particular machine. For more information, please see â€œAPPENDIX A: MACHINESâ€ on page 79. 

# 5.3.2 AUDIO TRACKS (TRACK 1â€“8)

Tracks 1â€“8 can be used as audio tracks. This is the default setting for these tracks. Each audio track contains a preset. The preset contains the settings in the PARAMETER pages (SRC, FLTR, AMP, FX, and MOD), the settings in the PRESET SETUP menu, and the ARPEGGIATOR menu. Tracks 1â€“8 can also be used with a MIDI SRC machine, which then converts the audio track into a MIDI track. Each audio track has two insert effect slots, separate sends to the three send effects, two voice LFOs, a modulation envelope, and two FX LFOs dedicated as modulation sources for the trackâ€™s selected FX machines 

# 5.3.3 BUS TRACKS (TRACK 9â€“12)

A bus lets you route multiple tracks into one channel to process them simultaneouslyâ€”you can use one signal chain to affect an entire group of tracks, adding effects, and adjusting the level for the whole group. Tonverk has four separate buses, each with its own sequencer track. Each bus has two insert effect slots, separate sends to the three send effects, and two LFOs. The bus tracks can also simultaneously function as MIDI tracks, using the parameters on the SRC, FLTR, and AMP pages. 

# 5.3.4 SEND FX TRACKS (TRACK 13â€“15)

Tonverk has three Send FX tracks. For each track, you can select an FX machine that will be one of the patternâ€™s Send FXs. You also have two LFOs on each track, dedicated as modulation sources for the trackâ€™s selected FX machine. 

# 5.3.5 MIX TRACK (TRACK 16)

Tonverk also has a Mix track. This track allows you to control the Mixer parameters, including track levels and audio input settings. Here, you can select an FX machine to be the patternâ€™s main FX. You also have two LFOs on the track dedicated as modulating sources for the selected FX machine. 

# 5.3.6 MIDI TRACKS (TRACK 1â€“12)

The MIDI tracks function almost identically to the audio tracks. Parameter locks, LFO modulation, and copy/paste commands are available. Each MIDI track also features micro timing, individual track length, and time signature settings. The primary difference is that the MIDI tracks do not generate sound; instead, the sequencer data is transmitted through the MIDI OUT or USB ports. 

Any of the tracks 1â€“12 can be used as a MIDI track. They are used to control external, MIDI-equipped gear. Each MIDI track can trigger up to 16 notes per step with adjustable parameters, including velocity and length, as well as control pitch bend and aftertouch. Additionally, 16 freely assignable MIDI control change parameters (MIDI CCs) are available. For more information, please see â€œA.2.4 MIDIâ€ on page 82. Any MIDI channel can be assigned to a MIDI track, and several tracks can share the same channel. If several tracks are assigned to the same MIDI channel, the track with the lowest number has priority in the event of parameter conflicts. 

To use tracks 1â€“12 as a MIDI track, you must first assign a MIDI machine to it. 

1. Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [SRC] to open the MACHINE menu. 

2. Use [UP]/[DOWN] to select the MIDI machine, and then press [YES] to assign it to the track. 

![image](images/c98a8e71fb14fa5014a606c6484d2ad6171e29563d8ee585fce3c7112968cf1d.jpg)


â€¢ If you select a MIDI machine for a Bus track (tracks 9â€“12), the Bus track doubles as a MIDI track, with both the MIDI and bus-related parameters available. 

â€¢ Both Audio- and Bus tracks retain their selected FX machines even if you assign a MIDI SRC machine to the track. 

# 5.3.7 SELECTING TRACKS

Press [TRK] $^ +$ [TRIG 1â€“16] to select a track without triggering the trackâ€™s preset (if it is an audio track). When not in any recording mode, press [TRIG 1â€“16] to select a track and trigger its preset (if it is an audio track). If you select track 9â€“16 and your previously selected track was an audio track, the [KEY-BOARD] still plays the previously selected audio track.

# 8. TONVERK CONTROLS

# 8.1 TRIG KEYS

The [TRIG] keys have several uses, including, for example, triggering an audio/MIDI track from the active pattern. They can also be used for placing trigs in the RECORDING modes. When pressed in combination with the [PTN] and [SONG] keys, they select patterns and songs. The [TRIG] keys light up to indicate the position of placed trigs and to indicate the chosen bank and track. 

# 8.2 ROTARY ENCODERS

The MAIN VOLUME, LEVEL/DATA and DATA ENTRY knobs are relative encoders which may be spun any number of turns. Pressing and turning the DATA ENTRY knobs, will change their associated values at a greater speed. 

# 8.3 KEY BEHAVIOR

As a group, the track selection keys (the [TRIG] keys) have radio button functionality, i.e. when a new track is set to be active, the previous one is simultaneously deactivated. Only one track can be selected at a time. Likewise, the group consisting of the six [PARAMETER PAGE] keys also has radio button functionality. 

# 8.4 MIDI NOTES AND MESSAGES

Some functions can be triggered by sending MIDI note values from an external MIDI device (a MIDI keyboard or a computer, for example) connected to Tonverk via a MIDI or USB cable. 

The 128 notes in the standard MIDI range (0-127) all trigger the preset of the active track in its chromatic variations (as if played by the [KEYBOARD] keys (see section below), from lowest to highest pitch. 

MIDI program change messages 0â€“127 will select pattern 1â€“128 (A01â€“H16) on Tonverk. Additionally, MIDI CC and NRPN messages can be sent to control various aspects of Tonverk. For more information, please see â€œAPPENDIX D: MIDIâ€ on page 103. 

# 8.5 THE [KEYBOARD]

You can use the [KEYBOARD] keys to play the preset of the active audio track (or send MIDI notes if the active track has a MIDI SRC machine selected). Press [TRK] $^ +$ [TRIG 1â€“12] keys to select the track you want to play. 

Press the lit trig keys to play different notes. The whole note range you can trigger spans 7 octaves. You can transpose the keyboard up or down 3 octaves from the middle octave. Press $[ + ] / [ - ]$ to transpose the virtual keyboard up or down in octave steps.

OFF In this mode, all the [KEYBOARD] keys play all notes chromatically and ignore the selected scale. 

LIGHT In this mode, all the [KEYBOARD] keys play all notes chromatically and ignore the selected scale, but the [KEYBOARD] keys within the selected SCALE will light up. 

SNAP In this mode, all the [KEYBOARD] keys play notes within the selected scale. The [KEY-BOARD] keys that are not within the scale will play the note that is closest within the scale. 

FILTER In this mode, only the [KEYBOARD] keys within the selected scale will play notes. 

GUIDE (with CHORD set to ON) decides which notes will play when you press the [KEYBOARD] keys. 

OFF In this mode, the [KEYBOARD] key you play will always sound, whether it is within the selected scale or not. However, the notes added by the chord mode, always play within the chosen scale and are based on the ROOT, SCALE, and SHAPE settings. If the key played is not within the scale, the added notes will derive from the nearest lower note within the scale. 

LIGHT In this mode, the [KEYBOARD] key you play will always sound, whether it is within the selected scale or not. However, the notes added by the chord mode, always play within the chosen scale and are based on the ROOT, SCALE, and SHAPE settings. If the key played is not within the scale, the added notes will derive from the nearest lower note within the scale. The [KEYBOARD] keys within the chosen SCALE will light up. 

SNAP In this mode all the [KEYBOARD] keys played will play notes within the selected scale. If you play a key that is not within the scale, it will play the note that is closest within the scale. The notes added based on the ROOT, SCALE, and SHAPE settings will also play within the selected scale. 

FILTER In this mode, only the [KEYBOARD] keys within the selected scale will play notes and trigger chords within the scale. 

CHORD switches CHORD MODE on/off. The keyboard now plays multiple notes with each key press. The notes added are based on the ROOT, SCALE, and SHAPE settings. 

![image](images/d667e2e5a949c11c2c5bc793f64b8d83a74abddd8b8dc6e25eb48b1257e89595.jpg)

This setting governs which notes are playable on Tonverkâ€™s [KEYBOARD] keys to allow only notes in the set scale (with FILTER set to LOCK) and which notes will sound when CHORD is set to ON. For a list of all selectable keyboard scales, please see â€APPENDIX E: KEY-BOARD SCALESâ€ on page 119. 

TYPE/SHAPE With SCALE set to CHROMATIC, you have here a selection of different types of chords (for example, MAJ, MIN, MIN7, MAJ7, DIM) to choose from. With SCALE set to anything but CHRO-MATIC, diatonic chords in the scale are created, and SHAPE sets which notes in the chord are used. 

For example, with ROOT set to C and SCALE to ION (white key notes only), and SHAPE set to 1-3-5: 

Playing a C note, this will create the notes C, E, G (C major) 

Playing a D note, this will create the notes D, F, A (D minor) 

Playing a C note on 1-3-5-7 will create the notes C, E, G, B (C major 7th), etc 

# 8.6 MUTE MODE

You can use MUTE mode to mute sequencer tracks 1â€“16. In MUTE mode, you can access all tracks for muting. However, if you want to mute the subtracks on a track that uses the Subtracks SRC machine, this track needs to be active when you enter MUTE mode. Muting the parent track using the [TRIG] key mutes all the subtracks. 

Press [MUTE] to enter MUTE mode and then press [TRIG]/[SUBTRACKS] to mute the corresponding track. Press again to unmute. The light of the [TRIG]/[SUBTRACKS] keys indicates the mute status. Unlit keys are muted tracks. Green lit keys are active tracks. Press [MUTE] to exit MUTE mode. If you are not in MUTE mode, but have muted one or several tracks/subtracks, the [MUTE] key will be lit dimly green. In MUTE mode, on a track that uses a Subtracks machine, if you mute a subtrack, the trackâ€™s [TRIG] key will be lit dimly green. 

The MUTE mode settings are saved together with the project. 

![image](images/5e1b7ab02db988f333e5f8b31b6691bd33b93d37bdff1f209be24256ba56e4d8.jpg)


You can also quick mute tracks by pressing [MUTE] $^ +$ [TRIG]/[SUBTRACKS]. 

# 8.7 TRIG MODES

The various TRIG modes affect the functionality of the [TRIG 1â€“16] keys. Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [DOWN] to access the TRIG MODE menu and then use [UP]/[DOWN] to select which TRIG mode should be active. The selected TRIG mode is active for all the tracks. All actions performed using the trig modes can be recorded in LIVE RECORDING mode.

# 9. PATTERNS, PRESETS, INSTRUMENTS AND SAMPLES

The patterns are the primary data container for Tonverk. Sixteen patterns are available for each of the eight banks, resulting in 128 patterns for each project. A pattern contains up to 16 presets (one for each track), as well as sequencer data such as trigs and parameter locks. It also includes the default settings on the TRIG page, as well as BPM, length, swing, and time signature settings. 

A preset that has been imported from the SD card to a pattern becomes part of the active pattern. Any changes made to a preset will therefore not affect the stored preset. It will only affect the preset in the active pattern. You can save a preset from the active pattern to the SD card. For more information, please see â€œ9.1 THE FILE MENUâ€ on page 31. 

![image](images/8e5d58f9fe4716dcb971924fae6a14a66e5672530894c191dc04be2e5bed9b0e.jpg)


A preset imported to a pattern becomes an independent copy of the preset on the SD card. It is not linked to the original preset on the SD card, and instead becomes a part of the pattern. 

# A pattern contains:

â€¢ All the presets used on the patternâ€™s tracks. 

â€¢ Routing settings. 

â€¢ Sequencer data, such as trigs and parameter locks, for the 16 tracks. 

â€¢ The settings on the TRIG page, BPM, length, swing, and time signature settings. 

# A preset contains:

A preset is a sample (for the Single Player machine), eight separate samples collected in an Instrument (for the Subtracks machine) or a multi-sample Instrument (for the Multi Player machine) plus all the track settings in the SRC, FLTR, AMP, FX (only the settings for the two insert effects), and MOD parameter pages. If you have selected the MIDI machine as a SRC machine, the preset will not contain any samples. For more information, please see â€œA.2 SRC MACHINESâ€ on page 79. 

# An instrument is:

An instrument contains the samples and the sample mapping used to create a multi-sample that the Subtracks and Multi Player machines play. The instrument also includes information such as Sample level, Loop length, Tune, and Play Mode. 

# A sample is:

Tonverk can load and play WAV and AIFF audio files (samples) with 16/24/32-bit depth (floating and fixed point) and a sample rate of 48 kHz (mono and stereo interleaved). Files with other sample rates (44.1 kHz/ 88.2 kHz/ 96 kHz) can also be loaded, but they will gracefully degrade in quality when played back. For more information, please see â€œ5.2.4 SAMPLESâ€ on page 19.

# 10. THE SEQUENCER

Tonverkâ€™s sequencer stores its information in patterns. A pattern controls the playback of the tracks and various pattern-specific aspects of the tracks. Patterns are stored in projects. A project contains eight banks (A to H), each with 16 patterns, resulting in 128 patterns available for each project. 

# A pattern contains:

â€¢ General trig settings on the TRIG page (default note pitch, velocity, etc.). 

â€¢ The settings on the PARAMETER pages. 

â€¢ The settings in the SETUP menu. 

â€¢ Quantization settings. 

â€¢ Note trigs and Lock trigs for all tracks. 

â€¢ Parameter locks. 

â€¢ Length and time signature for the tracks. 

# 10.1 PATTERN OPERATIONS

Tonverk can seamlessly switch between patterns. Together with the ability to chain patterns, this is a handy feature when improvising live. For more information, please see â€œ10.1.3 CHAINSâ€ on page 35. 

# 10.1.1 SELECTING BANK AND PATTERN

Press [PTN] and then use the [SUBTRACKS] keys to select a bank (if you want to choose a pattern from another bank than the current). Then press [TRIG 1â€“16] to select a pattern. 

If you just want to choose a pattern within the current bank, press [PTN] $^ +$ [TRIG 1â€“16]. 

Press [PTN] or [NO] to exit bank/pattern selection. 

White [TRIG] keys indicate pattern positions that contain data. A red [TRIG] key indicates the current active pattern. Empty patterns are unlit. 

When a pattern is playing, and a new pattern is selected, the new pattern number will be shown flashing in the upper left corner of the screen. Once the last step of the pattern has played, the new pattern will begin, and the pattern number will stop flashing. 

![image](images/f53432ed92b7c4b2c865e24523e6f9f329c514bc23082467d39edf47c584bdcc.jpg)


â€¢ Patterns can be changed while the sequencer is running. 

â€¢ Patterns can be changed and queued by sending program change messages. 

# 10.1.2 PATTERN CONTROL

Press [PLAY] to start the playback of a pattern. Press [STOP] to stop the playback of all tracks. The sound will be cut off, but effects like Delay will continue to be audible until the delay repeats have faded out. Quickly press [STOP] $^ +$ [STOP] to stop playback of all tracks and get just a short fade out of the send effects. 

When a pattern is playing, press [PLAY] to pause the playback. Press [PLAY] to resume the playback. 

If a pattern contains more than 16 sequencer steps, the small square boxes at the top of the screen will indicate this. When a pattern is playing, the active pattern page is shown with a blinking unfilled square. 

# 10.1.3 CHAINS

Chains are sequences that consist of more than one pattern. You can use chains to preselect and automate the order in which you want your patterns to play. 

![image](images/113889ba35ae72d3e8181049e89c7eee6b886adb5808825a091648a5e504ff24.jpg)


You can create one chain and use any pattern in bank Aâ€“H. The chain can consist of up to 64 patterns. 

1. Ensure you are in the SEQUENTIAL TRANSITION mode. You can only create chains in this mode. For more information, please see â€œ10.1.4 TRANSITION MODEâ€ on page 36. 

2. Press [PTN] to enter the pattern selection. 

3. Press and hold [TRIG 1â€“16] to select the first pattern in the chain. 

4. Press [TRIG 1â€“16] keys in the same order as you want the chained patterns to play. Keep the previously selected [TRIG] key pressed while you press the next one, the one after that, and so on. You can press the same [TRIG] key again if you wish to add the pattern multiple times in a row. If you want to add a pattern from another bank, use the [SUBTRACKS] keys to select bank and then press [TRIG 1â€“16] to select pattern. 

5. Press [PLAY] to start the sequencer and play the chain. The chain will loop when the final pattern of the chain has been played. 

To exit chain mode, select a pattern or song using the normal selection process. 

![image](images/a5f6945d32b954ff92f02f20ca65dffbb3913859813b5007efe44a7624e6dfad.jpg)


Please note that the chain will be lost when you create a new chain, select a new pattern, or song. You cannot save chains, and they will be lost when you switch Tonverk off. 

![image](images/014d7a922153d7ff83dc8d0d335cec162c168c192d02599c73f1d2a28f555263.jpg)


â€¢ Chains can be created while the sequencer is running. 

â€¢ TRANSITION mode must be set to SEQUENTIAL if you wish to create chains. 

# 10.1.4 TRANSITION MODE

When changing patterns, the different TRANSITION modes affect the way the active pattern changes to the next pattern. Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [PTN] to open theTRANSITION mode select menu. Either keep holding [FUNC] while pressing [PTN] to cycle through the modes, or use [UP]/[DOWN] and then press [YES] to select mode. 

![image](images/7fe993bc20d5592b7524cc7a5d0eb99e7122b3a3c2bc8c398b9d26e76bf78497.jpg)


There are four TRANSITION modes. 

SEQUENTIAL changes patterns after the currently playing pattern reaches its end. This mode is the default mode. 

DIRECT JUMP immediately changes patterns. The new pattern will start playing from the position where the previous pattern left off. 

DIRECT START immediately changes patterns. The new pattern will start playing from the beginning. 

TEMP JUMP immediately changes patterns and the new pattern starts playing from the position where the previous pattern left off. It plays the new pattern once to the end and then returns to the pattern that was playing before the change. 

You can also use TEMP JUMP mode when you are in CHAIN mode, but then the pattern you change to instead replaces the current pattern in the chain. For example, say that you have a chain set up like this: $A 0 1 > A 0 3 > A 0 4 > A 0 2$ . When the chain is playing, and you are in TEMP JUMP mode, change pattern to A16 while pattern A03 is playing. The pattern will immediately change to A16, and once A16 has ended, then the chain will continue to play from pattern A04. 

# 10.2 EDITING A PATTERN

Tonverk offers several input modes when creating or editing a pattern. The modes are GRID RECORDING mode, LIVE RECORDING mode, and STEP EDIT mode. In these modes, you can enter two types of trigs: Note trigs and Lock trigs. 

# 10.2.1 TRIG TYPES

A trig is a sequencer event that you can place when you want the sequencer to perform an action on Tonverk. There are two types of trigs that you can use, note trigs and lock trigs. 

â€¢ NOTE TRIGS trigger preset notes or MIDI notes. 

â€¢ LOCK TRIGS trigger parameter locks (but do not trigger notes). For more information, please see â€œ10.10.1 PARAMETER LOCKSâ€ on page 40. 

Red [TRIG] keys indicate note trigs, and yellow [TRIG] keys indicate lock trigs. Unlit [TRIG] keys indicate steps that do not contain any trigs. Read more about parameter locks in section â€œ10.10.1 PARAMETER LOCKSâ€ on page 40. The method of adding trigs to the sequencer depends on the active record mode â€“ GRID RECORDING or LIVE RECORDING. Note trigs can also be added using STEP EDIT. 

# 10.3 GRID RECORDING MODE

GRID RECORDING is a method of composing where you use the [TRIG] keys to add trigs. 

1. Press [RECORD] to enter GRID RECORDING mode. The [RECORD] key lights up red to indicate that GRID RECORDING mode is active. 

2. Select the track to which you want to add trigs by pressing and holding [TRACK] and then one of the [TRIG] keys. A white [TRIG] key indicates the active track. 

3. Place note trigs on the sequencer using the sixteen [TRIG] keys. To add a lock trig, press [FUNC] $^ +$ [TRIG]. Quickly pressing the [TRIG] key of any of the trigs entered will remove the trig. Pressing a [TRIG] key and holding it, prepares the trig for editing, rather than removing it. 

4. Select another track, and add note trigs. Repeat the procedure for all the tracks you want to use. 

5. Press [PLAY] to listen to the sequence. 

Add micro timing to a note trig by pressing and holding the [TRIG] key, and then pressing [LEFT]/[RIGHT]. For more information, please see â€œ10.5 MICRO TIMINGâ€ on page 39. 

Set the retrig speed by pressing and holding the [TRIG] key while navigating to TRIG PAGE 1 and make the desired settings. For more information, please see â€œ10.7 RETRIGSâ€ on page 39, and â€œ11.1 TRIGâ€ on page 46. 

If the pattern contains more than 16 steps, select the pattern page you want to edit by pressing the [PAGE] key. A fully lit <PATTERN PAGE> LED shows the active pattern page. 

Press [RECORD] to exit the GRID RECORDING mode. 

![image](images/74f63ee575163878cb6ae7a669e5c25bf3131153f3bb3e96ee08bbf3a0aa725f.jpg)


â€¢ If you use an external MIDI controller to record to Tonverkâ€™s MIDI tracks, the sequencer receives data on the Auto MIDI channel and records on the active track. For more information, please see â€œ17.2.3 CHANNELSâ€ on page 71. 

â€¢ All trigs placed on a track or subtrack can be shifted forward or backward on the sequencer. While in GRID RECORDING mode, press [FUNC] $^ +$ [LEFT]/[RIGHT] to move the trigs backward or forward. 

# 10.3.1 STEP EDIT

STEP EDIT is part of the GRID RECORDING mode and gives you a practical way to add and remove notes/trigs on specific sequencer steps using the [KEYBOARD]. 

1. In normal playback mode, press [STEP EDIT]. 

2. Press the [TRIG] key to where you want to add/remove notes. The [TRIG] key turns green. 

3. Use the [KEYBOARD] to add/remove notes to the selected trig. 

4. Press [STEP EDIT] again to exit STEP EDIT. 

![image](images/ed6ce1f0d6a5e3d2dab52050685c3d22253fa0b5bddf0a03458a1ef897d7ff08.jpg)


â€¢ You can also access STEP EDIT when you are in GRID RECORDING mode. The procedure is the same, but you need to press and hold the selected [TRIG] key while you are adding/removing notes. Also, notes added this way replace any previously added notes on that trig. 

â€¢ You can also use an external MIDI keyboard to add notes using STEP EDIT. 

# 10.3.2 SEQUENCE LANE

To make it easier to edit a pattern, you can use the Sequence lane functionality to select which sequencer events you want to view and interact with using the [TRIG] keys. This is especially useful when you have recorded a sequence and want to edit it with more precision. In GRID RECORDING mode, the chosen sequence lane is displayed at the top of the screen, next to the to the sequencer pages. 

![image](images/bef90a9fc8a26873fb6023146ea2eb7cb4fa135ef33e2c28558ca302471ffbfa.jpg)


1. Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [UP] to open the SEQUENCE LANE menu. 

2. Use the [UP]/[DOWN] keys to select which sequence lane you want to view and interact with. 

NOTES lets you view and interact with Note trigs only. Trigs that contain Note trigs are shown with red [TRIG] keys. Trigs that contain Lock trigs are shown with faint yellow [TRIG] keys. Pressing an empty [TRIG] key (or a [TRIG] key that contains a Lock trig) adds a Note trig. Pressing a [TRIG] key that contains a Note trig, removes it. Pressing a [TRIG] key that contains both a Note trig and a Lock trig only removes the Note trig. 

P-LOCKS Lets you view and interact only with Lock trigs (with or without parameter locks). Trigs that contain Lock trigs are shown with blinking yellow [TRIG] keys. Trigs that contain Note trigs are shown with faint red [TRIG] keys. Trigs that contain both Note trigs and Lock trigs are shown with blinking red [TRIG] keys. Pressing an empty [TRIG] key adds a Lock trig. Pressing a [TRIG] key that contains a Lock trig, removes it. Pressing a [TRIG] key that contains both a Lock trig and a Note trig only removes the Lock trig. 

NOTES $^ +$ P-LOCKS This is the default option and it lets you view and interact with both Note trigs and Lock trigs (with or without parameter locks). Trigs that contain Note trigs are shown with red [TRIG] keys. Trigs that contain Lock trigs are shown with yellow [TRIG] keys. Trigs that contain both Note trigs and Lock trigs are shown with blinking red [TRIG] keys. Pressing an empty [TRIG] key adds a Note trig. [FUNC] $^ +$ [TRIG] adds a Lock trig. Pressing a [TRIG] key that contains a Note trig removes it. Pressing a [TRIG] key that contains a Lock trig converts it to a Note trig. Pressing a [TRIG] key that contains both a Lock trig and a Note trig removes both the Note trig and the Lock trig. 

3. Press [NO] to exit the SEQUENCE LANE menu. 

For more information, please see â€œ10.2.1 TRIG TYPESâ€ on page 36. 

# 10.4 LIVE RECORDING MODE

LIVE RECORDING mode is the second method of adding trigs to the tracks. In this recording mode, the [TRIG] keys are played in real-time to input trigs to the tracks. You can also use KEYBOARD mode to add note trigs chromatically. It is also possible to enter parameter locks in real time. Trigs input in LIVE RE-CORDING mode can be automatically quantized or not. Non-quantized trigs can be quantized after they are recorded by using the QUANTIZE menu that is accessed by pressing [FUNC] $^ +$ [TRIG]. For more information, please see â€œ10.8 QUANTIZE MENUâ€ on page 39. 

1. Press and hold [RECORD], then press [PLAY] to enter LIVE RECORDING mode. (Press [PLAY] twice while keeping the [RECORD] key pressed to activate/deactivate automatic quantization.) The sequencer starts to play, and the [RECORD] key starts to flash red. 

2. Press the [TRIG] keys to add trigs in real time. You can also use the [KEYBOARD] to play the active track chromatically. If the active track has a Subtracks SRC machine assigned, you can play all eight Subtracks by pressing the [SUBTRACKS] keys. Any changes to the PARAMETER pageÂ´s settings made using the DATA ENTRY knobs are recorded as parameter locks and add lock triggers where needed. 

3. Press [PLAY] to exit LIVE RECORDING mode while keeping the sequencer playing. If LIVE RECORD-ING mode is active and [RECORD] is pressed, GRID RECORDING mode will be activated. 

4. Press [STOP] to stop both recording and playback of the sequencer. 

![image](images/f7ae8e0a05181436d95de22dd94aacf4ef3ea4a457b6f8769c909a38bb32323e.jpg)


You can use an external MIDI controller such as a keyboard to input NOTE, TRIG VELOCITY, and TRIG LENGTH data in LIVE RECORDING mode. Just play the notes on the external keyboard, and the sequencer will record them. The first note sets the TRIG VELOCITY value for all notes on the trig. The last note that is released sets the TRIG LENGTH for all notes on the trig. 

# 10.5 MICRO TIMING

![image](images/b526b3d7863464ccf6145b41aafcf5a121507f5a3c077265fe0b5fc4f91c9e70.jpg)


Here you can add micro timing to a note trig, moving it ahead or behind the beat. Micro timing can be customized on any of the sequencer steps on both audio and MIDI tracks. In GRID RECORDING mode, press and hold one or several [TRIG] keys and then press [LEFT]/[RIGHT] to access the pop-up MICRO TIM-ING menu that shows the time offset for the chosen sequencer step(s) on the active track. Press [LEFT]/ [RIGHT] to adjust the time offset in large increments. Press [UP]/[DOWN] to adjust the time offset in small increments. To exit the MICRO TIMING menu, release the [TRIG] key(s). The micro timing settings are stored in the active pattern. 

# 10.6 TRANSFORM MENU

Here you can affect certain aspects of the trigs already placed on a track. The Transform actions affect all the trigs on the selected track. Press [FUNC] $+ [ - ]$ to access the TRANSFORM menu. 

![image](images/eec0dbcc71f38c140517dc679ff5d06c401a147f2277a4442106ad25a4d8b182.jpg)


VELOCITY UNLOCK removes all parameter locks for the VEL parameter. 

VELOCITY RANDOMIZE randomizes the velocity of the trigs by placing parameter locks on the VEL parameter. 

VELOCITY RAMP UP sets the velocity of the trigs from low to high by placing parameter locks on the VEL parameter. 

VELOCITY RAMP DOWN sets the velocity of the trigs from high to low by placing parameter locks on the VEL parameter. 

PLACEMENT RANDOMIZE randomizes the placement of the trigs on the track. 

PLACEMENT REVERSE reverses the placement of the trigs on the track. 

# 10.7 RETRIGS

Retrigs can be customized on any of the sequencer steps on the audio tracks. In GRID RECORDING mode, press [TRIG PARAMETERS] to access the retrig parameters. Hold one or several [TRIG] keys and then set the desired retrig options for the trig(s). 

For more information about the parameters on this page, please see â€œ12.2 TRIG PAGE 1â€ on page 50. 

# 10.8 QUANTIZE MENU

The quantization affects all micro-timed and off-grid trigs on the sequencerâ€™s tracks. Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [KEY-BOARD G#] to access this menu. Change settings with DATA ENTRY knob E and F. 

![image](images/c9ec7601b2aba3037520142250085177ab57d63ef66ef5a2ccbae8fad9985cba.jpg)


TRK affects all the trigs of the active track in real-time. The higher the quantize value, the more the trigs will be quantized. Press [TRIG 1â€“16] key to select the track to quantize. 

PATTERN affects all the trigs of all tracks in the pattern in real time. The higher the quantize value, the more the trigs will be quantized. 

Press [NO] to exit the menu. 

# 10.9 PAGE SETUP MENU

You can set the length and timing of the pattern and the tracks in this menu. The sequencer has up to 256 steps, spread across 16 pages with 16 steps per page. Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [PAGE] to access the PAGE SETUP menu. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs to adjust the settings. 

You can assign individual length and speed to the tracks of the pattern. Here you find two sections, TRACK and PATTERN. 

![image](images/9a8e971375cee0d3e5d71d39afddcaf170a18afa35c3aff55461bbb268ce8d46.jpg)


The TRACK column sets the step length and speed of the track playback. The settings only affect the active track. 

The PATTERN column sets the master change length and the master length of the pattern. 

LENGTH sets the number of steps on the current pattern page. The leftmost number displays the number of steps on the active pattern page. If you use 17 steps or more in a pattern and GRID RE-CORDING mode is active, the [PAGE] key is used to toggle between the different pattern pages. Press [FUNC] and then turn data entry knob $\boldsymbol { \varepsilon }$ to change length in even steps of 16. 

SCALE controls the speed of track playback in multiples of the current tempo. For a setting of 1/8 plays back the track at one-eighth of the set tempo. 3/4 plays the track back at three-quarters of the tempo; 3/2 plays back the track twice as fast as the 3/4 setting. 2 makes the track play at twice the speed of the BPM. 

![image](images/7716d1707c7af66ae4d36f05d86ca6d1773393be388c7e1c6726dd45e103b463.jpg)


The SCALE setting also affects the speed of all LFOs, the delays time settings, the arpeggiator and retrig speed. 

CHANGE (Pattern Change) controls for how long the active pattern plays before it changes to a cued or chained pattern. This setting is essential when, for example, you set RESET to INF. Then, if you do not make any CHANGE setting, the pattern plays infinitely, and the following cued pattern will never play. By default, a cued pattern change happens at the end of the pattern (CHANGE set to OFF). 

RESET (Pattern Reset) controls the number of steps the pattern plays before all tracks reset and restart from the first step on the first page. An INF setting makes the tracks of the pattern loop infinitely, without ever being restarted. Note that this setting also affects how long the active pattern plays before a chained pattern starts playing. The CHANGE parameter overrides this if its parameter value is less than the RESET value. 

![image](images/25d62cf1e2f7b477b5ef7cb2f6f4a6d978f08359fd1a731c82c62be4a55360ee.jpg)


A SCALE setting of 2 helps increase the base resolution of the step sequencer to 32nd notes. A SCALE setting of 3/4 is practical when Tonverk is playing alongside other instruments set to the same BPM, and you want Tonverk to play triplets. 

# 10.10 SEQUENCER FEATURES

# 10.10.1 PARAMETER LOCKS

Parameter locks make it possible to set every trig to have its unique parameter values. The note trigs of an audio track can, for example, have different pitch, amp, or filter settings. It is possible to parameter lock the parameters found on the PARAMETER pages, and you can apply parameter locks to all types of tracks. For a complete overview of all parameters on the PARAMETER pages, please see â€œ12. AUDIO TRACK PARAMETERSâ€ on page 50 and â€œAPPENDIX A: MACHINESâ€ on page 79. 

Adding parameter locks in GRID RECORDING mode. 

1. Press [RECORD] to enter GRID RECORDING mode. 

2. Press a [TRIG] key to add a Note trig, or [FUNC] $^ +$ [TRIG] key to add a Lock trig, to where you want to perform a parameter lock. 

3. Press and hold the [TRIG] key of a previously placed trig (note trig or a lock trig). 

4. Turn the DATA ENTRY knobs that control the parameter you want to lock, and set it to the desired value. The graphics become inverted for the locked parameter, and the locked parameter value is displayed. The [TRIG] key of the locked trig blinks red (for note trigs) or yellow (for lock trigs) to indicate the trig now contains a parameter lock. 

Remove a single parameter lock by holding [TRIG] $^ +$ pressing the DATA ENTRY knob of the locked parameter. You can erase all parameter locks from a trig if you remove the note trig and then enter it again. 

Adding parameter locks in LIVE RECORDING mode. 

1. Press and hold [RECORD], then press [PLAY] to enter LIVE RECORDING mode. 

2. Turn a DATA ENTRY knob, or play the [TRIG] keys in KEYBOARD mode, to add parameter locks to the active track. Note trigs are placed, and parameter locked accordingly, and it also places lock trigs that contain the parameter locks on the sequencer steps that do not already have any trigs. 

Press [NO] $^ +$ one (or several) of the [TRIG] keys to erase a sequence of recorded trigs on a specific track (or on several tracks) in time with the sequencer, i.e. all held trigs reached by the patternâ€™s playhead will be erased. 

You can also remove specific parameter locks on a track in real time. In LIVE RECORDING mode, press and hold [NO] and then press and hold the DATA ENTRY knob corresponding to the parameter that you want to remove. 

![image](images/ac950cf4bfb0adeb89e83bab8684db0c871e76a91a884502a9f8fde710f1bc7a.jpg)


In GRID RECORDING mode, pressing and holding a [TRIG] key with parameter locks causes the [PARAMETER PAGE] key(s) containing the locked parameter to blink. 

# 10.10.2 TRIG CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONAL LOCKS

Trig conditions are a set of conditional rules that you can apply to any trig, using specific parameter locks called conditional locks. Each rule is a logical condition that determines whether a trig set on a track in the sequencer is triggered or not. If the specified condition is met, then the trig will play. If the condition is not met, the trig will not play. 

# ADDING A CONDITIONAL LOCK

1. In GRID RECORDING mode, place a note trig or lock trig on the sequencer step to where you want to apply a conditional lock. 

2. Press and hold the trig to access the COND (Trig Condition) parameter on TRIG PAGE 1. For more information, please see â€œ12.2 TRIG PAGE 1â€ on page 50. 

3. Turn DATA ENTRY knob H to select one of the following trig conditions: 

FILL The trig plays when FILL mode is active. 

FILL The trig plays when FILL mode not active. 

PRE The trig plays only when the previously evaluated trig on the same track has been played. (PRE and PRE conditions are not evaluated and are ignored. The sequencer instead evaluates the last non-PRE or PRE trig.) 

PRE Trig doesnâ€™t play if the previously evaluated trig has been played. (PRE and PRE conditions are not evaluated and are ignored. The sequencer instead evaluates the last non-PRE or PRE trig.) 

For example: 

Trig 1 Probability $= 5 0 \%$ (Trig 1 plays) 

Trig 2 Condition $=$ PRE (Trig 2 plays) 

Trig 3 Condition $=$ PRE (Trig 3 plays) 

Trig 4 Condition $=$ PRE (Trig 4 does not play) 

NEI The trig plays if the most recently evaluated trig condition on the neighbor track was true. (PRE and PRE conditions are not evaluated and are ignored. The sequencer instead evaluates the last non-PRE or PRE trig.) The neighbor track is the track before the active track. For example, track 3 is the neighbor track of track 4. NEI and NEI conditional trigs on track 4 therefore evaluate the conditional 

trigs placed on track 3. If no conditional trigs exist on the neighbor track the NEI condition is not met and will never play the trig. 

NEI The trig plays if the most recently evaluated trig condition on the neighbor track was not true. (PRE and PRE conditions are not evaluated and are ignored. The sequencer instead evaluates the last non-PRE or PRE trig.) 

1ST The trig only plays on the first loop of the pattern. 

1ST The trig does not play on the first loop of the pattern but on all consecutive loops. 

LST The trig plays the last time the pattern plays before changing to another pattern. 

LST The trig does not play the last time the pattern plays before changing to another pattern. 

A:B A sets how many times the pattern (or track, if the track length is shorter than the pattern length) plays before the trig condition is true. B sets how many times the pattern (or track, if the track length is shorter than the pattern length) plays before the count is reset and starts over again. This cycle then repeats until you stop the sequencer. 

For example: 

With the setting 1:2, the trig plays the first time the pattern is played and then the third, the fifth, and so on. 

With the setting 2:2, the trig plays the second time the pattern is played and then the fourth, the sixth, and so on. 

With the setting 2:4, the trig plays the second time the pattern is played and then the sixth, the tenth, and so on. 

With the setting 4:7 the trig plays the fourth time the pattern is played and then the eleventh, the eighteenth, and so on. 

A:B The trig with this condition plays when the set A:B condition of pattern plays are not met. 

For example: 

With the setting 2:4, the trig does not play the second time the pattern plays and then not on the sixth, the tenth, and so on.

Conditional parameter locks are a great way to add variety to a pattern. To set up a grid of mutually exclusive or conclusive note trigs across any of the tracks, and adding some probability locks in there as well (perhaps, in turn, also sporting an array of logically conditioned trigs), is a neat way to make the most minimal of compositions come alive with randomness. 

![image](images/729bb576e29028362c4ddba7b6d09edc0bc7cd8dba567317a05d8cc499e7c93e.jpg)


The sequencer must be in FILL mode to activate the FILL and FILL conditional locks. For more information, please see â€œ10.10.3 FILL MODEâ€ on page 42. 

FILL trig conditions may also be used, for example, to have two different melodic or percussive sequences on the same track, one of which is activated only when FILL mode is active. 

# 10.10.3 FILL MODE

FILL mode can be used to create a temporary variation, such as a drum fill, in your pattern by activating the trigs that have a FILL conditional lock. For more information, please see â€œ10.10.2 TRIG CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONAL LOCKSâ€ on page 41. You set the FILL mode behavior in the FILL EDIT menu. 

Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [FILL] to open the FILL EDIT menu. Use [UP]/[DOWN] to select FILL mode option you want. Press [YES] to close the FILL EDIT menu. The two options are: 

MOMENTARY FILL mode is active for as long as you press and hold [FILL]. 

LATCHING Press [FILL] to toggle FILL mode on/off. 

# 10.10.4 COPY, PASTE, AND CLEAR OPERATIONS

Patterns, tracks, track pages, parameter pages, and trigs can be copied, pasted, and cleared. 

The active pattern can be copied to another location in the same bank or another bank. To perform a pattern copy operation, GRID RECORDING mode must be deactivated. Copy the pattern by pressing [FUNC] $^ +$ [RECORD]. Select another pattern, and then press [FUNC] $^ +$ [STOP] to paste the copied pattern to this location. Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [PLAY] and then [YES] in the confirmation pop-up window to clear all the trigs in the current pattern. 

Individual sequencer tracks can be copied, pasted, and cleared in the same way as patterns. To do so, GRID RECORDING mode must be active. Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [RECORD] to copy the trackâ€™s trigs. Select another track and then press [FUNC] $^ +$ [STOP] to paste the copied trigs to this location. Press [FUNC] 

$^ +$ [PLAY] to clear all the trigs in the current pattern. 

A single track pageâ€™s trigs can also be copied, pasted, and cleared. It is similar to copying, pasting, or clearing a track, but will only affect the active track page. In GRID RECORDING mode press the [PAGE] key to select the track page you wish to copy. Press [PAGE] $^ +$ [RECORD] to copy. Select a new track page and press [PAGE] $^ +$ [STOP] to paste. Press [PAGE] $^ +$ [PLAY] to clear the active track page. 

You can also copy, paste, and clear a trackâ€™s preset (the settings on the [PARAMETER PAGES]). Press [TRK] $^ +$ [RECORD] to copy. Select a new track and press [TRK] $^ +$ [STOP] to paste the preset. Press [TRK] $^ +$ [PLAY] to reset the presetâ€™s parameters. 

A single parameter page with all its settings may also be copied, pasted, and cleared. Select the parameter page you wish to copy by pressing a [PARAMETER PAGE] key. Copy by pressing [PARAMETER PAGE] $^ +$ [RECORD]. Select a new track and then press the same [PARAMETER PAGE] page $^ +$ [STOP] to paste. Press [PARAMETER PAGE] $^ +$ [PLAY] to clear the parameter page and reset the parameters to their default settings. 

Trigs, complete with all parameter lock settings, can be copied, pasted, and cleared as well. GRID RECORDING mode needs to be active to access this functionality. Press and hold a trig and press [RECORD] to perform the copy operation. Paste by holding another [TRIG] key and press [STOP]. It is also possible to copy more than one trig. Press and hold the trigs you wish to copy, and then press [RE-CORD]. Press and hold the [TRIG] key to where you want to paste, and then press [STOP] to paste the copied sequence of trigs. When pasting, the copied trigs are placed in the same relation to each other as they had when they were copied. The destination trig acts as the starting point for the sequence of copied trigs. Press and hold one or more trigs, and then press [PLAY] to clear trig locks. 

# 10.10.5 TEMPORARY MEMORIZE AND RECALL PATTERN

Patterns can be instantly memorized in a temporary memory space and then recalled from this space. 

â€¢ Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [D1#] to temporarily memorize the active pattern. This is useful for creating a restore point when you are live tweaking, but without permanently saving your changes. 

â€¢ Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [C1#] to recall a pattern that was previously temporarily memorized. It will recall the pattern from when you last used the temporary memorize command. If you have not done any temporary memorization, then the pattern will be recalled from the permanently saved state. 

![image](images/d232c145a8a25ece41df139503ac3e90c41a28e4599d3077ea43978640072da9.jpg)


The TEMPORARY MEMORIZE PATTERN and TEMPORARY RECALL PATTERN commands are great when improvising live. Any changes made to the active pattern can immediately be undone. And at the same time, the memorizations and recalls will not affect the pattern permanently. 

![image](images/2a801d89a67afb6d54064d64eb43ef1fac1d8dc09107ed9e4398f22205d1b4c6.jpg)


The TEMPORARY MEMORIZE PATTERN command will not save the pattern permanently, and any changes will be lost if you load another project or switch off the device. 

# 10.10.6 TRACK TRANSPOSE

You can use this functionality to transpose all the note trigs on the active track. 

1. Press [FUNC] $+ [ + ]$ to initiate track transpose. 

2. Press the [KEYBOARD] keys to transpose the trackâ€™s note trigs. Use the $[ + ] / [ - ]$ keys to access other octaves on the [KEYBOARD]. 

3. Press [NO] to exit track transpose.

The songs are automatically saved as they are created and edited. However, you must save the project if you wish to keep the songs before switching to another project. 

# 10.12 PERFORM MODE

In PERFORM mode, any changes made to the preset parameters in the pattern are kept in a temporary memory location. It means you can keep your parameter tweaks as long as you are in PERFORM mode, but when you exit PERFORM mode, the pattern reloads to its previously saved state. You can only be in PER-FORM mode on one pattern at a time. If you are in PERFORM mode on one pattern and switch to another, the PERFORM mode will remain active on the first pattern when you return to it. However, if you enter PER-FORM mode on the second pattern, you lose the PERFORM mode tweaks made to the first pattern. 

Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [TRK] to toggle PERFORM mode on/off. The [TRK] key is lit green when PRFORM mode is active 

![image](images/973dbef2f093dad2244202994ef3a06409dedf68ee3cd70e44efa0236c653b21.jpg)


Actions done in PERFORM mode are not saved and will not remain when switching the device off. Saving the pattern will not save any changes done in PERFORM mode. 

# 11. THE TRACK SETUP MENU

The TRACK SETUP menu contains several setup pages related to the active track, its behavior, and setup. You can access specific TRACK SETUP menu pages (or page groups) by using [FUNC] $^ +$ [PARAMETER PAGE] keys. Depending on which PARAMETER key you selected, you open the setup pages related to the primary function of that parameter key. You can also navigate between the different pages within the TRACK SETUP menu using the [PARAMETER PAGE] keys. If a page group has more than one page, you use the groupâ€™s [PARAMETER PAGE] key to cycle through the pages. Use [UP] and [DOWN] to move between the options.

# 11.1 TRIG

Here you can set several note and trig-related parameters. Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [TRIG] to directly access this page. These settings are only available for audio tracks (Track 1â€“8). 

![image](images/bfce4219d05271569bae620aaaa3ed857ae968623287b43691f9a022858413c9.jpg)


# 11.1.1 PLAY MODE

Here, you can set whether a preset is polyphonic or monophonic and whether the LFOs for each voice are synced or not. This setting is not availble for the Subtracks machine. 

POLY The Sound is polyphonic, and the LFOs for each voice are running independently of each other. 

POLY M.LFO In POLYPHONIC WITH MONO LFO mode, the preset is polyphonic, and the LFOs for each voice are synced together with the first voice LFO. The LFO of the first voice played determines the cycle of the LFOs, and the subsequently played voicesâ€™ LFOs are synced to this cycle. This makes the LFO behave like a single or monophonic LFO. This is useful, for example, if you want to use the LFO for a tremolo effect. 

MONO The preset is monophonic, and the envelope is always triggered by each note on, or key press. 

MONO LEG. In this mode, the preset is monophonic; however, the envelopes are not triggered by a subsequent note or key press if the first note is still held. 

# 11.1.2 MONO NOTE PRIO

Here, you can set the note priority, i.e., which note is played if more than one note is played simultaneously. This setting is only available if PLAY MODE is set to MONO or MONO LEG. This setting is not availble for the Subtracks machine. 

LAST gives priority to the last note played. 

LOW gives priority to the lowest note played. 

HIGH gives priority to the highest note played. 

# 11.1.3 REUSE VOICES

Sets if the same note played twice should reuse the same voice, or cycle to use another free voice. 

ON Reuses the same voice. Useful for staccato effects and drums. 

OFF Cycles to use another voice. Suitable for piano-like sounds and pads. 

# 11.1.4 PORTAMENTO

Sets the behavior of the portamento when enabled for the track. This setting is not available for the Subtracks machine and is only affecting the sound if PLAY MODE is set to MONO or MONO LEG. For more information, please see â€œ12.3 TRIG PAGE 2â€ on page 51. 

MONO Portamento affects all notes played 

MONO LEG. Portamento only affects notes played legato. 

# 11.1.5 LOOP MODE

Sets the behavior Single Player machineâ€™s loop mode when PLAY MODE is set to FORWARD LOOP or REVERSE LOOP. This setting is not availble for the Multi Player and Subtracks machines. 

SUST. Sustain makes the sample loop for as long as the envelope is in the sustain phase. Once in the release phase, the sample plays to the end and then stops. 

CONT. Continuous makes the sample loop through both the envelopeâ€™s sustain and release phases. 

# 11.1.6 OCTAVE

Sets the base octave of the preset. It also makes preset locking more practical since you can control the octave setting on the preset and minimize the need to transpose the sequencer notes to make two or more presets work together. This setting is not availble for the Subtracks machine. 

# 11.1.7 PITCH BEND DEPTH

![image](images/40b35653d2181d4ff61cba7c9b93f2cd12398087ebaad62dbd35b068f68ee586.jpg)


# NOTE

Trig Note sets the pitch of the note when trigged. When in LIVE RECORDING mode and using the [KEY-BOARD ] to enter notes, the pitch of the [TRIG] keys played will override this setting. The NOTE parameter is not available for tracks that have the Subtracks SRC machine assigned. 

# VEL

Trig Velocity sets the velocity of the sequencerâ€™s note trigs. 

# LEN

Trig Length sets the length of the note trig. In LIVE RECORDING mode, the duration of pressing the [TRIG] keys overrides this general setting. 

# PROB

Trig Probability sets the probability that the trigs on the track play or not. The probability outcome is re-evaluated every time a trig is set to play. The default setting is $100 \%$ , meaning that all the trigs on the track will play every time. This parameter can be parameter locked, which lets you assign separate trigs their own probability. 

# RTRG

Retrig enables multiple trig repeats on placed trigs. Use DATA ENTRY knob A to turn retrig on/off. For more information, please see â€œ10.7 RETRIGSâ€ on page 39. 

# RTIM

Repeat Time sets the retrig rate. 1/16 is the nominal retrig rate, one trig per step. 1/32 corresponds to two trigs per step and so on. To do triplets, for example, set the retrig rate to 1/12 (or 1/24). 

# RVEL

Repeat velocity sets the velocity curve fade-out and fade-in of the retrig. -1 corresponds to a complete fade out during the set length, -0,5 fades out to half the velocity during the set length, 0 equals a flat velocity curve with no fade, 0.5 fades into half velocity during the set length, and 1 fades in completely to full velocity during the set length. Please note that the effects of the VFAD setting is also dependent on the VEL setting on TRIG PAGE 1. 

# COND

(Trig Condition) when you add a conditional lock, COND sets the Trig Condition with which a set of conditional rules can be applied to any trig, using a conditional parameter lock. For more information, please see â€œ10.10.2 TRIG CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONAL LOCKSâ€ on page 41. 

# 12.3 TRIG PAGE 2

â€¢ With BASE set to 0, the filter functions as a low-pass filter with WDTH adjusting the frequency range. 

â€¢ With WDTH set to 127, the filter functions as a high-pass filter with BASE adjusting the frequency range. 

â€¢ With WDTH set to 0, the filter functions as a band-pass filter with BASE adjusting the frequency. 

â€¢ With BASE set to 0 and WDTH set to 127, the filter does not affect the sound. 

# DEL

Envelope delay sets the time before the attack phase of the filter envelope starts. This parameter is part of the filter envelope that controls the FLTR machine. You can also press and hold [FUNC] and then turn DATA ENTRY knob A to access this parameter from FLTR page 1 quickly. This parameter only affects the Multimode filter on FLTR page 1. 

# SPRD

Frequency Spread offsets the filter cutoff frequency in the left and right channels. 

# KEY.T

Keytrack sets how much the filter cutoff frequency is affected by what note is playing. The higher the KEY.T setting, the more the filter opens up at higher notes. This parameter is only available for the Single Player and Multi Player machines. 

# BASE

Sets the base frequency of the filter. 

# WIDTH

Sets the frequency width above the base frequency. 

# RSET

Envelope Reset sets the filter envelope behavior. This parameter only affects the Multimode filter on FLTR page 1. 

ON resets the envelope for each consecutive trig. The envelopeâ€™s attack phase is reset to zero. 

OFF does not reset the envelope for each consecutive trig (default). The envelopeâ€™s attack phase continues from where it was left off. 

# 12.7 AMP PAGE

The AMP page controls parameters for the amplitude envelope, panning, and volume. 

![image](images/cfccf76fa8ec5127f15998fb58534d85d28f8d869e15c8690bf4fad31a46af40.jpg)


# ATK

Attack Time sets the length of the attack phase of the amp envelope. 

# HOLD

Hold Time sets the length of the hold phase of the amp envelope. Fixed Hold time values (0â€“126) specify the length of the hold phase, and the envelope ignores Note Off events such as Trig Length, releasing a [TRIG] key, or a key on an external controller. Setting HOLD to NOTE means the hold phase will be determined by Note On and Note Off events. This parameter is only available if ENVELOPE MODE in the TRACK SETUP menu is set to AHD. 

![image](images/3e599e8a85dec3b219c32b656ec1ef88b16c301de71393f12bc3ec93e7699e95.jpg)


If you set HOLD to NOTE and use an external keyboard to trigger the envelope, the sound will be sustained (if DEC is set to a value less than 127) for as long as you press a key on the keyboard. 

# DEC

Decay Time sets the length of the decay phase of the amp envelope. When ENVELOPE MODE is set to AHD, DECAY works as the REL parameter, defining the time from end of HOLD to 0. 

# SUS

Sustain Level sets the sustain level of the amp envelope. This parameter is only available if ENVELOPE MODE in the TRACK SETUP menu is set to ADSR. 

# REL

Release Time sets the length of the release phase of the amp envelope. This parameter is only available if ENVELOPE MODE in the TRACK SETUP menu is set to ADSR. 

# OVER

Overdrive sets the amount of overdrive and clipping distortion of the signal entering the filter. 

# PAN

Pan positions the audio of each voice in the stereo field. The knob function is bipolar with 0 being the balanced midpoint, L64 sends all sound to the left channel and R63 sends all sound to the right. 

# VOL

Volume sets the volume amount of the amplifier. Unlike the track level (LEV), this parameter can be parameter locked and is saved with the preset. For the Subtracks machine, this parameter sets the amp level for every separate subtrack. 

![image](images/2b657520a3e4f9e54271a06b6232743062129c22ea68ca5b0b0ac3abf2c5cd4b.jpg)

# SPD

Speed sets the speed of the LFO. Try settings of 8, 16 or 32 to sync the LFO to straight beats. The knob is bipolar. The LFO cycle can be played backward by using negative values. 

# MULT

Multiplier multiplies the SPD parameter by the set factor, either by adjusting the current tempo (BPM settings) or by applying a fixed tempo of 120 BPM. 

# FADE

Fade In/Out allows for fading in and out of the LFO modulation. The knob is bipolar. Positive values produce a fade-out, while negative values produce a fade-in. 0 gives no fade-in/fade-out. (-64â€“63) 

# DEST

Destination selects the modulation destination for the LFO. Preview how the LFO modulation will affect the sound by highlighting a destination. Press [YES] to confirm the selection. Press [NO] to cancel and revert to previous selection. For more information, please see â€œAPPENDIX B: LFO/MOD ENVELOPE MODULATION DESTINATIONSâ€ on page 98. 

# WAVE

Waveform sets the LFO waveform. The Triangle, Sine, Square, Sawtooth, and Random waveforms are bipolar. The Exponential and Ramp are unipolar. 

# SPH

Start Phase sets the point within the wave cycle where the LFO will start when it is trigged. 0 makes the LFO start at the beginning of a complete wave cycle, 64 makes it start at the center. A small square at the start of the waveform shows that the wave cycle begins at a zero-crossing. If WAV is set to RND then the SPH parameter changes to SLEW and adds slew to the transitions in the waveform. 

# MODE

Trig Mode determines how the LFO behaves when a note is triggered. 

â€¢ FREE is the default free-running mode. It makes the LFO run continuously, never restarting or stopping even if notes are trigged. 

â€¢ TRIG makes the LFO restart when a note is trigged. 

â€¢ HOLD makes the LFO run free in the background, but when a note is trigged, the LFO output level is latched and held still until the next note is trigged. 

â€¢ ONE The LFO starts when a note is trigged, then runs to the end of the waveform and then stops. This makes the LFO function similar to an envelope. 

â€¢ HALF The LFO starts when a note is trigged, then runs to the middle of the waveform and then stops. 

# DEP

Depth sets the depth and polarity of the LFO modulation. Both negative and positive modulation depths are possible. A center setting, 0.00, equals no modulation depth. 

# 12.13 MOD PAGE 2 (VOICE LFO 2)

MOD page 2 contains the same parameters as VOICE LFO page 1, but controls VOICE LFO 2. 

# 12.14 MOD PAGE 3 (MOD ENVELOPE)

# 13. BUS TRACK PARAMETERS

The parameters that are available on the Bus tracks are explained in this chapter. For more information about Bus tracks, please seeâ€5.3.3 BUS TRACKS (TRACK 9â€“12)â€ on page 20. On the SRC, FLTR, and AMP PARAMETER pages, you will find parameters for when using the Bus track to control external MI-DI-controlled devices (if you have assigned a MIDI SRC machine to the track). For more information about these parameters, please see â€œA.2.4 MIDIâ€ on page 82. On the FX parameter pages, you have parameters for selecting and editing the Bus trackâ€™s FX machines, setting the send levels from the track to the send FX, and also setting the track routing. On the MOD pages, you have two LFOs dedicated as modulation sources for the trackâ€™s selected FX machines. 

# 13.1 EDITING THE BUS TRACK PARAMETERS

Press [TRK] $^ +$ [TRIG 9â€“12] to select the Bus track you want to edit. There are six PARAMETER pages for the Bus tracks. Press [TRIG], [SRC], [FLTR], [AMP], [FX], and [MOD] to access the tracks PARAMETER page groups. Use the [UP]/[DOWN] keys to access the parameter groupâ€™s pages. You can also press a [PARAMETER PAGE] key repeatedly to cycle through that groupâ€™s parameter pages. Press and hold a [PA-RAMETER PAGE] key to see the values for all parameters on that page. 

The track parameters can be locked to other settings at any step of the pattern by first pressing and holding the [TRIG] key, then adjusting the parameter settings with the DATA ENTRY knobs.For more information, please see â€œ10.10.1 PARAMETER LOCKSâ€ on page 40.

# NOTE

Trig Note sets the pitch of the note when trigged. When in LIVE RECORDING mode and using the [KEY-BOARD] to enter notes, the pitch of the [TRIG] keys played will override this setting. The NOTE parameter is not available for tracks that have the Subtracks SRC machine assigned. 

# VEL

Trig Velocity sets the velocity of the sequencerâ€™s note trigs. 

# LEN

Trig Length sets the length of the note trig. In LIVE RECORDING mode, the duration of pressing the [TRIG] keys overrides this general setting. 

# PROB

Trig Probability sets the probability that the trigs on the track play or not. The probability outcome is re-evaluated every time a trig is set to play. The default setting is $1 0 0 \%$ , meaning that all the trigs on the track plays every time. This parameter can be parameter locked, which lets you give separate trigs their own probability. 

# RTRG

Retrig enables multiple trig repeats on placed trigs. Use DATA ENTRY knob A to turn retrig on/off. For information on setting retrig locks on specific trigs in the sequencer, please see â€œ10.7 RETRIGSâ€ on page 39. 

# RTIM

Repeat Time sets the retrig rate. 1/16 is the nominal retrig rate, one trig per step. 1/32 corresponds to two trigs per step and so on. To do triplets, for example, set the retrig rate to 1/12 (or 1/24). 

# RVEL

Repeat velocity sets the velocity curve fade-out and fade-in of the retrig. -1 corresponds to a complete fade out during the set length, -0,5 fades out to half the velocity during the set length, 0 equals a flat velocity curve with no fade, 0.5 fades into half velocity during the set length, and 1 fades in completely to full velocity during the set length. Please note that the effects of the VFAD setting is also dependent on the VEL setting on TRIG PAGE 1.

# 16. SAMPLING

Tonverk is a very competent and accessible sampler. It can sample audio from external sources via the external inputs, and it can also sample audio internally from Tonverk itself. There are two different sampling methods: you can use either the Recorder or the Auto Sampler. 

# 16.1 THE SAMPLING MENU

The SAMPLING menu within the Recorder provides settings that control various aspects of sampling. The maximum sampling time when using the SAMPLING menu is 6.06.06 minutes and this is always available even if a projectâ€™s RAM is fully utilized. 

Press [SAMPLING] to enter the SAMPLING SELECT screen, and then use [UP]/[DOWN] to select RE-CORDER, and then press [YES] to access the SAMPLING menu 

![image](images/f1063549fd368e88ea3bfe7794e33daaf961a8e9bcdb6b69599a16208676de80.jpg)


# 16.1.1 REC

Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [YES] to start sampling. Press [YES] to stop sampling. 

# 16.1.2 ARM

Press [YES] to arm the sampler. The sampler is now in arm mode, and it will start sampling when the incoming audio exceeds the threshold level. See THR below. Press [SAMPLING] + [NO] to cancel. 

# 16.1.3 RLEN

Record Length sets the length of the sampling. With a setting of 1/16â€“16/1, the sampling length is decided by the time it takes the sequencer to advance a set number of steps at the current BPM. For example, the settings 1/16, 1/8, 1/2, 1/1, and 16/1 correspond to sampling durations of 1 sequencer step, 2 steps, 8 steps, 16 steps, and 256 steps, respectively. With the MAX setting, sampling continues until the maximum sampling time is reached or until you press [YES] to stop sampling. 

# 16.1.4 THR

If you have selected to arm the sampler, the sampling begins when the incoming audio signal exceeds the threshold setting. Set the threshold high enough so that it is not triggered by background noise, but low enough that you capture all of the signal. 

# 16.1.5 SRC

Source selects between different incoming audio sources to sample from. 

â€¢ IN A+USB L sets the input source to INPUT A and USB in L. 

â€¢ IN B+USB R sets the input source to INPUT B and USB in R. 

â€¢ IN + USB sets the input source to INPUT $\mathsf { A } { + } \mathsf { B }$ and USB ${ \mathsf { L } } + { \mathsf { R } } { \mathsf { \Omega } }$ 

â€¢ MAIN sets the input source to Tonverkâ€™s internal Mix track. the audio is sampled after the main FX. 

â€¢ TRK.1â€“8 sets the input source to one of Tonverkâ€™s internal tracks 1â€“8. 

â€¢ BUS.1â€“4 sets the input source to one of Tonverkâ€™s buses 1â€“4. 

# 16.1.6 MON

2. Press [SAMPLING] to enter the SAMPLING SELECT screen, and then use [UP]/[DOWN] to select RECORDER, and then press [YES]. If you have previously in the session used the Auto sampler, press [LEFT] to enter the SAMPLING SELECT screen. 

3. Use DATA ENTRY knob G to set SOURCE to your preferred audio input source. 

4. Keep an eye on the audio input meter and play the audio source, ensuring the volume is as strong as possible without clipping or distortion. The notches at the right end of the meter indicate 0 dB. Set MON to YES to monitor the incoming audio through Tonverk. 

5. Again, with an eye on the audio input meter, use DATA ENTRY knob F to set THR just above the indicated background noise of the audio source (when it is not playing). 

6. Use RLEN to set the sampling length. 

7. Press [YES] to arm the sampler and then play the sound source. When the incoming audio signal exceeds the set threshold level, sampling will start. 

8. Press [YES] when you want to stop sampling, or with an RLEN setting, the sampling will stop automatically. The sampling also stops if it reaches the maximum sampling time. 

9. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs A and B to set the parameters START and END to trim the sample to the desired length. You can use the DATA ENTRY knob D to zoom in and out making it easier to see where to trim the sample. Use C to pan left and right if the sample is zoomed in. Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [YES] to preview the sample. (The preview is played back by the voice of the active track. Make sure to select track 1â€“8 as the active track). LOOP makes the previewed sample loop (when enabled). Press [LEFT] to toggle LOOP on/off. Press [UP] if you wish to normalize the sample to 0 dB. 

10.When you are happy with your settings, press [YES] to trim the sample. After you have trimmed the sample, you can press [NO] to untrim it if you are not satisfied with the result. 

![image](images/517ec41d0836b2e259e0b98ca3a3842970ffd223a1cd0e3e023622831379cbc2.jpg)


11. On the NAMING page, name the sample and press [YES] again to confirm the save. The sample is saved on the Tonverk SD card in the folder USER/RECORDINGS

You can only assign the sample to a track with a Single Player SRC machine selected. Only those tracksâ€™ LEDS will light up and be selectable. 

# 16.3 THE AUTO SAMPLER

You can also use the Auto Sampler functionality to perform sampling and create instruments. The Auto Sampler helps you sample from other MIDI-equipped devices, such as synthesizers, by setting up a sample session where you can define the note range, the number of notes within the range, velocity layers, note duration, and release time. 

# 16.3.1 SAMPLING AUDIO USING THE AUTO SAMPLER

1. Connect a MIDI cable from the Tonverk MIDI Out connector to the MIDI input of the device you want to sample from. 

2. Connect audio cables from the device you want to sample to Tonverkâ€™s IN A/B inputs, or connect an USB C cable from the sample source to Tonverkâ€™s USB 1 input.. 

3. On the external device, select the sound you want to sample. 

4. On Tonverk, press [SAMPLING] to enter the SAMPLING SELECT screen, and then use [UP]/ [DOWN] to select AUTO SAMPLER, and then press [YES]. If you have previously in the session used the Recorder, press [LEFT] to enter the SAMPLING SELECT screen. 

5. Select the sampling source (SRC) and then select the MIDI channel to which the external device is listening (MIDI CHAN). 

6. Press [YES] to play a test note. The Autosampler will measure the latency and correct for it. It will also measure the release time of the sound you want to sample and set a release time that accounts for the full release of the sound. 

7. Use LTNCY to manually adjust the latency if you want to adjust the latency compensation set by the test note in step 6. 

8. Use RELEASE TIME to manually set a release time if you want to adjust the release time set by the test note in step 6. 

9. Press [RIGHT] to navigate to the next setting page and then set the following parameters: 

START, END sets the note range you want to sample. 

SAMPLE EVERY sets the interval between the actual notes to be sampled within the selected note range. For example, if the note range is one octave and STEP is set to 1, every semitone within the range is sampled. With STEP set to 3, every third semitone within the range will be sampled, and so on. The first note sampled is always the lowest note selected by the START parameter. 

VELOCITY LAYERS sets how many separate velocities each note are sampled with. 

10.Press [RIGHT] and then use NOTE DURATION to set the time for which each sampled note should be held. 

11. Press [YES] to start the sampling process. 

Press [NO] to exit the Auto Sampler. 

When the auto-sampling process is complete, the instrument/sample is assigned a name and saved to the folder USER/MULTI-SAMPLED INSTRUMENTS on the SD card. The auto sampling process generates a number of files: one instrument (.elmulti) for use in the Multi Player machine and one single sample (.wav) containing all the sampled notes, one after another, for use in the Single player machine.

AUTO CHANNEL selects the MIDI channel that will give access to the currently active track. If an external MIDI keyboard connected to Tonverk sends MIDI data on this channel, the keyboard will control the active track. This is particularly useful, for example, when quickly switching between active audio tracks to play different presets. Tonverk also utilizes the AUTO channel to record MIDI tracks from external MIDI controllers. 

PROGRAM CHG IN CH selects the MIDI channel that will listen for incoming program change messages. An AUTO setting will use the AUTO channel. Enable Tonverk to respond to program change messages in the MIDI SYNC menu. For more information, please see â€œ17.2.1 SYNCâ€ on page 70. 

PROGRAM CHG OUT CH selects the MIDI channel that will send program change messages when changing patterns. An AUTO setting will use the AUTO channel. Enable Tonverk to send program change messages in the MIDI SYNC. For more information, please see â€œ17.2.1 SYNCâ€ on page 70.

TRACKS 1â€“16 have their own dedicated MIDI channel, which is used to receive or send (by turning the knobs) parameter data to or from a specific audio track. The MIDI channel number corresponds to the track number. 

![image](images/37ddbacd76eb26cbf0651b33bb7110c9b498164a03a1850b685438c7e862bdcc.jpg)


â€¢ The sequencer data is always sent on the MIDI channel specified by the CHAN parameter on the SRC PARAMETER page for the MIDI SCR machine. 

The selected MIDI channel for the Auto channel is only used for the Auto channel, and the track that uses the same channel does not listen to any MIDI data.

# APPENDIX A: MACHINES

A machine is a module within Tonverk that has specific functionality. A machine can be replaced with another machine of the same category. For example different synthesis engines or effects. Every machine has a particular set of parameters tailored to give you the most relevant and useful sound-shaping possibilities for that particular machine. For more information, please see â€œ5.3.2 AUDIO TRACKS (TRACK 1â€“8)â€ on page 20. 

Use the [UP]/[DOWN] keys to select the parameter group's pages. You can also press a [PARAMETER PAGE] key repeatedly to cycle through the parameter pages in that group. Press and hold a [PARAMETER PAGE] key to see the values for all parameters on that page. 

# A.1 ASSIGNING MACHINES TO THE ACTIVE TRACK

1. Press [TRK] $^ +$ [1â€“16] to select the active track. 

2. Press [FUNC] $^ +$ [SRC] or [FUNC] $^ +$ [FX] to open the MACHINE setup menus with the relevant machine category selected. 

3. Use [UP]/[DOWN] to select the machine, and then press [YES] to assign the selected machine to the track. 

The rest of this appendix lists the machine-specific parameters on the SRC and FX pages. The selected machine determines the parameters available. 

# A.2 SRC MACHINES

The SRC machines are sound engines that use a particular subset of the functionality of the sample playback engine. In this section, you also find the MIDI machine that lets you control external, MIDI-equipped gear. For more information, please see â€œ5.3.6 MIDI TRACKS (TRACK 1â€“12)â€ on page 20. You can assign any SRC machine to any of the Audio/MIDI tracks (Track 1â€“8). Additionally, you can also assign MIDI machines to the Bus tracks (Track 9â€“12). Press [SRC] to access these parameter pages. 

![image](images/314b438ac441f5b0636ba6686980257ba051a5e4d57e7a028eb8ce09a759b66d.jpg)


# A.2.1 SINGLE PLAYER

The Single Player machine plays a selected sample (mono or stereo) linearly (forward, reversed, or looped). This machine is eight voice polyphonic. When you select this machine you should use the SAM-PLE SLOT parameter to assign a sample to the machine. Press [SRC] to access this parameter page. 

![image](images/33444d39b89f9abaa35b337cef8d59e2c0b61befc1eeb1c17147d5236ad4d218.jpg)


# TUNE

Tune (DATA ENTRY knob A) sets the pitch of the sample. The knob works in a bipolar fashion, and a value of 0 leaves the pitch unchanged. The range is $+ / .$ - 5 octaves. Press and hold [FUNC], and then turn the DATA ENTRY knob to snap parameter values to full octaves. Press and turn the DATA ENTRY knob to snap parameter values to semitones. 

# PLAY MODE

Play Mode (DATA ENTRY knob B) sets the play mode of the sample. It controls how the sample will be played back when it is trigged. 

The different modes are: 

â€¢ REVERSE The sample will be played back in reverse once every time it is trigged. 

â€¢ REVERSE LOOP The sample will loop continuously in reverse between Loop Position and Length. The duration for which it will loop is set with the LEN parameter on the TRIG page. This time is also constrained by the AMP page envelopeâ€™s HLD and DEC parameters. 

â€¢ FORWARD LOOP The sample starts at the STRT position and loops continuously between the Loop Position and Length. The duration for which it will loop is set with the LEN parameter on the TRIG page. This time is also constrained by the AMP page envelopeâ€™s HLD and DEC parameters. 

â€¢ FORWARD The sample will be played back once every time it is triggered. 

# LOOP CROSSFADE

Loop Crossfade (DATA ENTRY knob C) sets the amount of the crossfade of the audio at the samples loop points. It crossfades the audio before the LSTR loop point with the audio before the LEND loop point. This parameter is only relevant if you set PLAY to REVERSE LOOP or FORWARD LOOP. 

# SAMPLE SLOT

Sample Slot (DATA ENTRY knob D), allows you to browse and assign samples to the Single Player machine. You can load up to 1023 samples for each project. The first position in Bank A, â€œOFFâ€, plays no sample. You must first load a sample from the SD card to the project before assigning it to a track. 

1. Turn DATA ENTRY knob D and then select an empty slot to where you want to load the sample. 

2. Press [YES] to open the Sample browser and view the SD cardâ€™s contents. 

3. Use the [ARROW] keys to navigate to the sample you want to load. [UP]/[DOWN]scrolls the list of folders and files. [YES] or [FUNC] $^ +$ [RIGHT] opens the highlighted folder. [NO] or [FUNC] $^ +$ [LEFT] navigates one level back up in the folder structure. 

4. Press [YES] to load the selected sample to the track. 

To load a previously added sample, turn DATA ENTRY knob D or use [UP]/[DOWN] to navigate to the sample you want to select, and then press [YES]. 

You can apply parameter locks to the SAMPLE SLOT parameter and change the sample on any step of the sequencer, so-called Sample locks. For more information, please see â€œ10.8.1 PARAMETER LOCKSâ€ on page 47. 

# STRT

Start Position sets the starting position for playing the sample. In REVERSE and REVERSE LOOP modes, it sets the end position. STRT and END together define the portion of the sample that is played. 

# LSTR

Loop Start sets the position in the sample to where playback will return to after reaching the LEND position of the sample if PLAY MODE is set to FORWARD LOOP. The sample is then looped between LSTR and LEND. If PLAY MODE is set to REVERSE LOOP, the sample loop will start at LEND, then move backwards to LSTR, and then loop between LEND and LSTR. 

# LEND

Loop End sets the loopâ€™s end position, playback of the sample from where it then returns to the LSTR position. 

# END

End Position sets the end position of the sample playback. In REVERSE and REVERSE LOOP modes, it sets the start position. STRT and END effectively define the portion of the sample that is played. 


FORWARD LOOP play modes.

# A.2.2 MULTI PLAYER

The Multi Player machine plays polyphonic multi-sampled instruments using mono or stereo samples. This machine is eight voice polyphonic. 

When you select this machine you are prompted to select an instrument. Use [UP]/[DOWN] to browse the instruments and then press [YES] to load the higtlighted item. You can use the [KEYBOARD] to preview the highlighted instrument before loading it. If you want to change instrument later, press [FUNC] $^ +$ [SRC], select the Multi Player machine again, and then select another instrument from the list. 

![image](images/d2d5956dd48a41cb952e7164fa9753d3fd004bd54c72355ffeb88b2622fb2431.jpg)


# TUNE

Tune sets the pitch of the sample. The knob works in a bipolar fashion, and a value of 0 leaves the pitch unchanged. The range is +/- 5 octaves. Press and hold [FUNC], and then turn the DATA ENTRY knob to snap parameter values to full octaves. Press and turn the DATA ENTRY knob to snap parameter values to semitones. 

# VIBR

Vibrato depth sets the amount of vibrato applied to the instrument. 

# SPD

Vibrato Speed sets the speed of the vibrato. 

# FADE

Vibrato Fade sets the time it takes for the vibrato to fade in or fade out. 

# A.2.3 SUBTRACKS

The Subtracks machine allows you to load eight samples (mono or stereo) into a pre-prepared instrument. Every sample is then loaded onto a separate subtrack on the sequencer and can be sequenced separately, with its own settings on the SRC, FLTR, AMP, and MOD pages. Use the eight [SUBTRACKS] keys to select a subtrack and to play the sample. Use [TRK] $^ +$ [SUBTRACKS] to select a subtrack without triggering the sample. This machine is eight-voice polyphonic, one voice per subtrack. 

The subtracks mostly have their own set of parameters they control, but there are some parameters that impact the sound of all subtracks. For this reason, the Subtracks machine has an additional sequencer track called the supertrack that is used to mainly handle parameter locks for these shared parameters. The supertrack controls the parameters on the FX pages and the two FX LFOs on the MOD pages. In addition, the supertrack has its own TRIG PARAMETERS page. This page is used to control the trig-sensitive parameters on the supertracks FX and MOD pages, such as the MODE parameter for the Track FX LFO. 

Press [TRK] $^ +$ [TRIG 1â€“8] twice to access the supertrack. Once to select the track that contains the Subtracks machine and then again to select the supertrack for that machine. When the supertrack is selected, this is shown on the screen with three white rectangles above the track number. Press [TRK] $^ +$ [SUBTRACKS] to exit the supertrack and select a subtrack. 

When you select this machine, you are prompted to choose an instrument. Use [UP]/[DOWN] to browse the instruments and then press [YES] to load the highlighted item. You can use the [KEYBOARD] to preview the highlighted instrument before loading it. If you want to change the instrument later, press [FUNC] $^ +$ [SRC], select the Subtracks machine again, and then select another instrument from the list.

# TUNE

Tune (DATA ENTRY knob A) sets the pitch of the sample. The knob works in a bipolar fashion, and a value of 0 leaves the pitch unchanged. The range is +/- 5 octaves. Press and hold [FUNC], and then turn the DATA ENTRY knob to snap parameter values to full octaves. Press and turn the DATA ENTRY knob to snap parameter values to semitones. 

# PLAY MODE

Play Mode (DATA ENTRY knob B) sets the play mode of the sample. It controls how the sample will be played back when it is trigged. 

â€¢ REVERSE The sample will be played back in reverse once every time it is trigged. 

â€¢ REVERSE LOOP The sample will loop continuously in reverse between Loop Position and Length. The duration for which it will loop is set with the LEN parameter on the TRIG page This time is also constrained by the AMP page envelopeâ€™s HLD and DEC parameters. 

â€¢ FORWARD LOOP The sample starts at the STRT position and will loop continuously between Loop Position and Length. How long it will loop for is set with the LEN parameter on the TRIG page. This time is also constrained by the AMP page envelopeâ€™s HLD and DEC parameters. 

â€¢ FORWARD The sample will be played back once every time it is triggered. 

# STRT

Start Position sets the starting position for playing the sample. 

# LEN

Length sets the duration of the sample playback. Start $^ +$ Length effectively defines the end point of the portion of the sample that is played. 

# L.ST

Loop Start sets the position in the sample to where playback will return to after reaching the Length Position (defined by STRT $^ +$ LEN) of the sample if PLAY MODE is set to FORWARD LOOP (FWD.L). The sample is then looped between the end of LEN and L.ST. If PLAY MODE is set to REVERSE LOOP (REV.L), the sample will start at LEN, then move backwards to L.ST, and then loop between LEN and L.ST. 

# A.2.4 MIDI

The parameters for the MIDI machine are divided across the TRIG, SRC, FLTR, and AMP PARAMETER pages. The MOD pages are the same as for audio tracks, but there are two LFOs available for MIDI tracks. 

![image](images/ad40f53511950da722b2bb4307ef020b0ec758d623fa4380b622c7e97285deac.jpg)


The tracks with a MIDI machine selected still have a TRACK LEVEL parameter, as you can route audio to any track, regardless of the machine selected for that track. 

# TRIG PAGE 1

Set the actions for when a note is trigged. Change settings using the DATA ENTRY knobs. These general settings affect note trigs placed in the sequencer. 

![image](images/f5573640f38963a29078af71f1af2cab955204e6d8002047a76cdc9de093a2e7.jpg)


# NOTE

Trig Note sets the pitch of the note when trigged. When in LIVE RECORDING mode and using the [KEYBOARD ] to enter notes, the pitch of the [TRIG] keys played will override this setting. The NOTE parameter is not available for tracks that have the Subtracks SRC machine assigned. 

# VEL

Trig Velocity sets the velocity of the sequencerâ€™s note trigs. 

# LEN

Trig Length sets the length of the note trig. In LIVE RECORDING mode, the duration of pressing the [TRIG] keys overrides this general setting. 

# PROB

Trig Probability sets the probability that the trigs on the track play or not. The probability outcome is re-evaluated every time a trig is set to play. The default setting is $100 \%$ , meaning that all the trigs on the track will play every time. This parameter can be parameter locked, which lets you assign separate trigs their own probability. 

# RTRG

Retrig enables multiple trig repeats on placed trigs. Use DATA ENTRY knob A to turn retrig on/off. For more information, please see â€œ10.7 RETRIGSâ€ on page 39. 

# RTIM

Repeat Time sets the retrig rate. 1/16 is the nominal retrig rate, one trig per step. 1/32 corresponds to two trigs per step and so on. To do triplets, for example, set the retrig rate to 1/12 (or 1/24). 

# RVEL

Repeat velocity sets the velocity curve fade-out and fade-in of the retrig. -1 corresponds to a complete fade out during the set length, -0,5 fades out to half the velocity during the set length, 0 equals a flat velocity curve with no fade, 0.5 fades into half velocity during the set length, and 1 fades in completely to full velocity during the set length. Please note that the effects of the VFAD setting is also dependent on the VEL setting on TRIG PAGE 1. 

# COND

(Trig Condition) when you add a conditional lock, COND sets the Trig Condition with which a set of conditional rules can be applied to any trig, using a conditional parameter lock. For more information, please see â€œ10.10.2 TRIG CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONAL LOCKSâ€ on page 41. 

# TRIG PAGE 2

On this page you access the portamento and set the portamento time. For more information, please see â€œ11.1.4 PORTAMENTOâ€ on page 46. 

# PTIM

![image](images/13c8096b97ded2eddb90c5bc75e5c90022e82103c6fe5186f233ac87f5dccfaa.jpg)


# SPD

Modulation Speed controls the frequency of a built-in triangle LFO. It is tempo-synced and the values are measured in sequencer steps. 

# DEP

Modulation Depth controls the amount of frequency modulation applied from the LFO to the comb filter. 

# SPH

LFO Start Phase controls the triggering behavior of the LFO. The parameter value OFF indicates that it will run free. Other values will cause the LFO to retrigger from that phase position every time a note is played on the track.

# FREQ

Frequency sets the resonant frequencies of the comb filter. It can be set to both positive and negative values. 

# FDBK

![image](images/6c12828aa4cb704a1501bf21754462c84c3a732a8b7ebfa9e61ff32b1a070c5a.jpg)


# THR

Threshold sets the threshold of the compressor. A lower threshold means a larger portion of the signal is subject to compression. 

# ATK

Attack Time sets the time of the compressor attack phase, i.e., how quickly the compressor responds to loud peaks. 

# REL

Release Time sets the duration of the compressorâ€™s release phase, i.e., how long it takes for the compression to recover during quieter moments 

# MUP

Makeup Gain sets the makeup gain of the compressor output to compensate for the reduced signal levels caused by compression. The Makeup Gain parameter value is displayed in dB. 

# RAT

Compression Ratio. There are eight different compression ratios: 1.50, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00, 16.00, and 20.00. Higher ratios result in greater signal compression. 

# SCS

Sidechain Source decides what audio source the compressor analyzes when it performs sidechaining. Sidechaining is the process when the compressor uses the output of an audio source to control the overall action of the compressor. For example, if you set SCS to TRK1 where you have a kick drum, every time the kick drum plays, the compressor lowers the overall sound of the mix. This paramater is only available when the compressor is used on the Mix track. 

MAIN sets the sidechain source to be the audio sent to the Main (L/R) outputs. 

TRK1â€“8 sets the sidechain source to be the audio sent from one of the separate audio tracks. 

IN L sets the sidechain source to be the audio coming from INPUT L. 

IN R sets the sidechain source to be the audio coming from INPUT R. 

# SCF

Sidechain Filter filters the signal from the sidechain source before the compressor analyzes it. The parameter ranges from a low-pass filter to a high-pass filter. Negative parameter values set a low-pass filter. Positive parameter values set a high-pass filter. 

When set as a low-pass filter, the compressor reacts mostly to bass frequencies. Use this setting for a characteristic pumping compressor sound. When set as a high-pass filter, the compressor reacts less to bass frequencies. Use this setting to avoid pumping. 

# MIX

Mix sets the mix of the uncompressed signal and the compressor output signal. A setting of 0 results in a completely uncompressed signal. A setting of 127 lets only the compressed signal pass through. All values in between mix the uncompressed signal with the compressed signal, which is known as parallel compression. 

# A.3.5 DAISY DELAY

A delay effect with more control over the stereo image and evolution over time. 

![image](images/8d81703905d24030a5e97384fcf03d1b8afa93960fa0067f8357940deb9be971.jpg)

# PRE

Pre-delay sets the pre-delay time of the reverb. 

# EARLY

Early Reflections sets the amount of early room reflections in the reverb. 

# DAMP

Damping determines how quickly the high-end frequencies of the reverb tail fade out, influencing the overall brightness or darkness of the reverb sound. 

# SIZE

Size sets the length of the decay phase of the reverberated signal, essentially setting the size of the simulated acoustic space. 

# LOWC

Lowcut sets the cutoff frequency of the reverbs low-pass filter. 

# HIGHC

HPF sets the cutoff frequency of the reverbs high-pass filter. 

# A.3.16 SATURATOR DELAY

The Saturator Delay effect takes the input signal, delays it in time and then rejoins it with the original signal.

# TIME

Delay Time sets the delay time. It is relative to the current BPM and is measured in 128th notes. 

<table><tr><td>TIME setting</td><td>Divide ratio</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1/128</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1/64</td></tr><tr><td>2.67</td><td>1/48 (1/32T)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>1/64.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>1/32</td></tr><tr><td>5.33</td><td>1/24 (1/16T)</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>1/32.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>1/16</td></tr><tr><td>10.67</td><td>1/12 (1/8T)</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>1/16.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>1/8</td></tr><tr><td>21.33</td><td>1/6 (1/4T)</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>1/8.</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>1/4</td></tr><tr><td>42.67</td><td>1/3 (1/2T)</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>1/4.</td></tr><tr><td>64</td><td>1/2</td></tr><tr><td>96</td><td>1/2.</td></tr><tr><td>128</td><td>1</td></tr></table>

# X

Ping Pong sets the delay signal to alternate across the stereo field. There are two settings: 

â€¢ OFF lets you manually set the position of the delay signal in the stereo field. Use the WID parameter to change the stereo field position. 

â€¢ ON makes the delay signal alternate between left and right pan positions. The WID parameter controls the amount of panning. 

# WID

Stereo Width sets the delay signal pan width across the stereo field. The knob is bipolar. 

# FDBK

Feedback Gain sets the amount of delay output signal to feed back into the input of the delay. With higher parameter settings, infinite and/or swelling delays are possible. Please be aware that high feedback can lead to a very loud signal. 

# HPF

High-pass Filter sets the cutoff frequency of the delay high-pass filter. 

# LPF

Low-pass Filter sets the cutoff frequency of the delay low-pass filter. 

# MIX

Dry/Wet sets the mix between the dry signal and the affected signal. This parameter is only available if the effect is used on an Audio track, a Bus track, or the Mix track. 

# A.3.17 SUPERVOID REVERB

The Supervoid Reverb effect controls the persistence, and ambient characteristics, of the sound reverberations. It can simulate many different sonic locations, from huge spaces to small rooms.

# PRE

Pre-delay sets the pre-delay time of the reverb. 

# DEC

Decay Time sets the length of the decay phase of the reverberated signal, essentially setting the size of the simulated acoustic space. 

# FREQ

FB Shelving Freq sets the shelving filter frequency. Together with the GAIN parameter, it can be used to dampen the reverberated signal above a chosen frequency, making the reverberation sound more prominent or more muffled. 

# GAIN

FB Shelving Gain affects the damping of the reverberated signal above the shelving frequency set by the FREQ parameter. At max value the treble is included in the reverberations; lowering the value gradually dampens it. 

# HPF

HPF sets the cutoff frequency of the reverb high-pass filter that affects the audio going into the reverb. 

# LPF

LPF sets the cutoff frequency of the reverb low-pass filter that affects the audio going into the reverb. 

# MIX

Dry/Wet sets the mix between the dry signal and the affected signal. This parameter is only available if the effect is used on a Bus track or the Mix track. 

# A.3.18 WARBLE

The Warble effect helps you recreate a sound similar to that of an old tape recorder by adding a pitch warble effect, along with audio and noise filtering.

# SPEED

Sets the speed of the warble effect: A setting of 0 makes the speed random. 

# DEPTH

Sets the depth of the warble effect. 

# BASE

Sets the base frequency of the filter. 

# WIDTH

Sets the frequency width above the base frequency. 

# N.LEV

Noise Level sets the amount of noise that is added to the effect. Please note that the noise level is not affected by the MIX setting. 

# N.HPF

High-pass filter sets the frequency for the high-pass filtering of the noise. 

# STEREO

Stereo Width sets the amount of the warble effect in the stereo field. 

# MIX

Dry/Wet sets the mix between the dry signal and the affected signal.

# APPENDIX E: SFZ SUPPORT

The primary and best-supported method of specifying multi-sampled instruments for the Multi player machine and the sample sets for the Subtracks machine on Tonverk is the native mapping format, which is found in the .eldrum and .elmulti files included in the factory library. 

However, a subset of the SFZ format can be loaded by Tonverk. This document describes the capabilities and limitations of that subset. 

# E.1 HEADERS

Tonverk supports the following headers. Note that all headers besides <region> are optional. 

â€¢ <control> 

â€¢ <global> 

â€¢ <master> 

â€¢ <group> 

â€¢ <region> 

All of the above, aside from <control>, support the same opcodes but have different scope and override semantics (see https://sfzformat.com/headers for more information on headers). 

# E.1.1 OTHER HEADERS

â€¢ <curve> headers are allowed to be present, but are ignored. 

â€¢ <effect>, <midi>, and <sample> headers are not supported, and files containing them will fail to load. 

# E.2 CONTROL OPCODES

Under the <control> header, the following opcodes are supported: 

â€¢ default_path sets the path where files are loaded relative to. Please note that the behavior of some players, which allows file-name prefixes in addition to distinct pathelements, is not supported. 

â€¢ note_offset transposes all regions by a number of semitones. 

â€¢ octave_offset transposes all regions by a number of octaves. 

For more information about opcodes, please see https://sfzformat.com/opcodes/ 

# E.2.1 IGNORED CONTROL OPCODES

For convenience, the following opcodes are ignored and will not cause an error if they are present: 

â€¢ hint_load_method 

â€¢ label_cc_* 

â€¢ set_cc_* 

Any other opcodes provided under the <control> header will result in an error. 

# E.3 REGION OPCODES

Headers <global>, <master>, <group>, and <region> all support the same set of opcodes. 

Pitch values can be specified as numeric MIDI key values or in IPN, where MIDI note 0 is called â€œC-1â€ (and consequently, middle C is C4). 

# E.3.1 REQUIRED OPCODES

A region (or a group, master, or global header preceding it) must minimally specify a sample (sample=...) and a pitch (via either key=... or pitch_keycenter=...). Regions that fail to meet this criterion will be ignored. 

The sample opcode is a file path, relative to the location of the SFZ file. Use UNIX-style paths (with forward slashes) for best results. 

Special rules for file names. 

â€¢ Space (blank) characters are allowed. 

â€¢ Equals $\left( = \right)$ and balanced angle brackets (e.g. My<Sample>.wav) are not allowed. 

â€¢ Comment-opening tokens (// or /*) are forbidden. 

â€¢ Any trailing blank characters are ignored. 

The â€œroot noteâ€ of the sample can be specified via pitch_keycenter (note that the special value pitch_keycenter=sample is not supported). If it is not provided, then the key opcode is required. 

All other opcodes are optional. 

# E.3.2 ZONES

â€¢ lokey and hikey are processed and checked for overlap, but are not used internally. Instead, incoming notes are played using the key zone with the nearest root note. 

â€¢ lovel and hivel define velocity layers. Up to 128 velocity layers are supported in each key zone. 

â€¢ lorand and hirand enable random selection of samples within a velocity layer. 

Special considerations: 

â€¢ All regions within the same velocity layer must either specify lorand and hirand, or not.â€™ 

â€¢ All regions within the same velocity layer must specify equal-sized and non-overlapping ranges of the random space. For example, a velocity layer with 4 samples can be specified like this: 

<region> lorand $\mathtt { \Gamma = 0 . 0 0 }$ hirand $_ { 1 = 0 . 2 5 }$ sample $\Bumpeq$ MySample1.wav <region> lorand $\mathtt { = 0 . 2 5 }$ hirand $\mathtt { = 0 . 5 0 }$ sample $: =$ MySample2.wav <region> lorand $\mathtt { = 0 . 5 0 }$ hirand $_ { = 0 . 2 5 }$ sample=MySample3.wav <region> lorand $= 0 . 7 5$ hirand=1.00 sample $: =$ MySample4.wav 

â€¢ Random distribution is mutually exclusive with ordered round-robin. 

â€¢ seq_length and seq_position enable ordered round-robin within a velocity layer. 

Special considerations: 

â€¢ All regions within the same velocity layer must either specify seq_length and seq_position, or not. 

â€¢ All regions within the same velocity layer must specify the same seq_length. 

â€¢ All regions within the same velocity layer must specify unique seq_position values in ascending order. 

â€¢ Ordered round-robin is mutually exclusive with random distribution. 

# E.3.3 PLAYBACK

Sample playback can be modified with the following opcodes: 

â€¢ offset and end set the playback start and end points, respectively. They are integers measured in audio samples. 

â€¢ loop_start and loop_end define the loop region, if any. 

Special considerations: 

â€¢ These opcodes can be spelled either with or without an underscore. If both are present, with-underscore overrides without-underscore. 

â€¢ Both are integers measured in audio samples. 

â€¢ If not present in the SFZ file, loop points can be read from the SMPL chunk of compatible WAV files. 

â€¢ The presence of one or both of these opcodes, or a loop region in the WAV fileâ€™s metadata, implies loop_mode=loop_sustain (but this can be overridden via loop_mode=no_loop also being present. 

â€¢ loop_mode controls both the state and behavior of looping. 

Special considerations: 

â€¢ This opcode can be spelled with or without an underscore. If both are present, with-underscore overrides without-underscore. 

â€¢ loop_mode $\Bumpeq$ one_shot behaves identically to loop_mode $\Bumpeq$ no_loop. 

â€¢ loop_crossfade controls the duration of crossfade at the end of each loop period. It is a floating-point number measured in seconds. Note that it cannot exceed the time between offset and loop_start, which both default to 0 if unset. 

# E.3.4 OTHER OPCODES

All other opcodes (including those relating to sound processing) are unsupported and will be ignored.
